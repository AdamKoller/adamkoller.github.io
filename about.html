            <h5>Who I Am</h5>
            <p> Initially as a mechanical engineering major at University, I eventually fell in love with programming instead and decided to change paths.
            When not coding, I love to spend my free time with my wife and daughter, exercising, cooking, playing golf, pondering philosophical questions, and drinking coffee! </p>

            <h5>What I Do</h5>
            <p> Although my coding journey only began not too long ago,I have become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and worked with the frameworks React and Bootstrap. I have also worked with Version Control Systems such as Git.</p>

          <div class='xp-box'>
            <h5>Where I Am</h5>
            <p> Located in the great city of Saint Louis, Missouri. Saint Louis holds a special place in my heart and not only has great things to offer, but also a thriving tech community with many innovative companies and startups. </p>

            <h5>Why I Do It</h5>
            <p> Let's face it, coding is fun. To have an idea from ground zero and seeing the successful end result perculates through my entire body. In my opinion, it's what makes having such a complex piece of machinery inside our heads such a joy and should not be taken for granted. </p>
